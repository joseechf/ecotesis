This is the place that shelters the hope of building a greener Azuero, the place where tons of ideas on how to continue to restore the region’s habitat are born. This compound holds the Azuero Eco Foundation office ever since it started. It is here where all the planning of our projects take place. Here, we receive people that is looking for information about environmental topics, it is a refuge of environmental knowledge. Every Friday, this becomes a school for the Pro Eco Pelaos, one of our environmental education programs. January 3rd, 2020, was a great day for our organization, as Edwina Von Gal, co-founder of the Azuero Earth Project, believing in our environmental efforts, has officially donated the house to our organization. Edwina Von Gal was the creator of this space, she dreamed that this compound would host such a commendable project.",
      "charrito": "The Azuero Spider Monkey, CHARRITO (Ateles geoffroyi azuerensis), is our indicator subspecies and guiding symbol because it is a vitally important but critically endangered species in the Azuero dry forest ecosystem. The few that remain on the planet live only on the Azuero. They are victims of rapidly decreasing habitat, hunting, and capture for the pet trade. They are particularly smart and cute, but also shy, which may be why they have managed to hold on this long. However, the loss of habitat and shrinking gene pool may be more than they can manage. We are working to stop the killing and capture of Spider monkeys, and all monkeys, and provide them with sufficient habitat to ensure their future."

Some Pro Eco Kids activities include planting in the garden, promotion of reusable bags to town residents, participation in the 2012 Pedasi Local Parade, visits to local protected areas and farms, and exciting guests from the community to engage the kids through their passion for different aspects of conservation and environmental issues.
